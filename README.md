## Hi, I'm David.

I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo, graduating in August 2025.

I have done 6 internships at the following companies: Tesla, Dagster Labs, Streamforge, Arctic Wolf, Aboard, and Maesos Technologies.

In my free time, I like to play badminton and basketball, and code up quick automation scripts in Python

Currently looking for New Grad opportunities for 2025.

Here is an open source project that I worked on at Dagster: https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/pull/26365

Here are all my open source contributions to Dagster (not all my work, most were internal): https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adliu27

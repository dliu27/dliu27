## Hey, I'm David, a CS student at the University of Waterloo in my 3rd year. 

I have 4 prior internships under my belt in 3 startups and 1 unicorn. During each internship, I have made a significant and measurable impact in full-stack projects throughout my internship career, gaining experience in a wide variety of technologies. Check out my experiences below for details!

Outside of work, 

I love to build hobby projects that solve my own problems or interests such as a SPA for searching Twitch creators, helper programs for booking badminton club sessions, and API tools for Valorant for inspecting my teammate's analytics. Check out some of my works here:

I have also been committed to the habit of learning data structures and algorithms knowledge daily. 

▶ In my other spare time, I enjoy playing basketball intramurals 🏀, playing badminton 🏸, flipping items on Kijiji 💹, cooking 👨‍🍳, and playing video games 🕹.

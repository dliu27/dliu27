## Hi, I'm David.

I'm currently working at Robinhood!

I'm graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

I have done 6 internships at the following companies: Tesla, Dagster Labs, Streamforge, Arctic Wolf, Aboard, and Maesos Technologies.

In my free time, I like to play badminton and basketball, and code up quick automation scripts in Python

Here is an open source project that I worked on at Dagster: https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/pull/26365

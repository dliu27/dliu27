## Hey, I'm David, a CS student at the University of Waterloo in my 3rd year. 

I have 4 prior full-stack developer internships under my belt, receiving ratings of "Outstanding" and "Excellent". I am lucky to have worked in a variety of environments (3 startups, 1 unicorn) in a unique set of fields (Influencer Marketing, Cybersecurity, HR Tech, and Agri Tech). Check out my experiences on my Linkedin for details!

Outside of work, 

I love to build hobby projects that solve my own problems or interests such as a SPA for searching Twitch creators, helper programs for booking badminton club sessions, and API tools for Valorant for inspecting my teammate's analytics. Check out some of my works here:

I have also been committed to the habit of learning data structures and algorithms knowledge daily. 

▶ In my other spare time, I enjoy playing basketball intramurals 🏀, playing badminton 🏸, flipping items on Kijiji 💹, cooking 👨‍🍳, and playing video games 🕹.
